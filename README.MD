# 🚀 Backend Learning Project – My Journey with Node.js, Express & MongoDB

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is all about me learning **backend development** from scratch — following tutorials by **Hitesh Choudhary**. I built this project while understanding the real-world structure of backend apps using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and all the essential tools that come along.

It’s not just code — it’s a full learning journey packed with:
- APIs
- Authentication
- File uploads
- Middleware
- Best folder structure
- And more backend magic 🧙

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

This project covers all the fundamentals of modern backend development:

- Setting up an Express server
- Creating and organizing routes
- Connecting MongoDB using **Mongoose**
- Building **REST APIs**
- Implementing **JWT-based authentication**
- Parsing and verifying tokens
- Handling file uploads with **Multer**
- Using **middlewares** smartly
- Writing modular and maintainable code
- Using tools like **Postman**, **Thunder Client**, and **MongoDB Compass**
